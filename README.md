Credits!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then a partially copy of Zell Liew's javascript calculator ( https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98 ), written with pure javascript, was used and converted into a React (approximate equivalent) application.
The CSS is almost an exact copy and saved a great deal of time!

You can see a working version of the calculator at http://cool-hose.surge.sh/

It's possible to publish very easily using surge ( https://surge.sh/ ) (Wow!)
